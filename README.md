# ECE291 Electrical Engineering Sophomore Projects

## Course Overview  
This repository contains coursework and projects from **ECE-291: Sophomore Electrical Engineering Projects** at [The Cooper Union](http://www.cooper.edu). The course focuses on **analyzing and constructing complex electrical systems** while reinforcing key engineering principles.  

### **Course Description**  
- **Electrical Engineering Principles** – Frequency response, noise, feedback, loading, and interfacing.  
- **Analog Circuit Design** – Construction and testing of amplifiers, oscillators, RF/opto-electronic circuits, and power circuits.  
- **Signal Processing** – Understanding heterodyning, envelope detection, and frequency modulation.  
- **Systems Engineering** – Development of a testbench, performance analysis, and proper documentation.  
- **Lab Instrumentation** – Hands-on experience using oscilloscopes, multimeters, function generators, and other tools.

## **Project Overview: Theremin Circuit**  
The primary project for this course involved designing and constructing a **Theremin**, an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact. The Theremin operates based on **frequency modulation**, where hand proximity to an antenna alters capacitance, affecting oscillator frequency and producing an audible tone.

### **Key Components**  
- **Oscillators and Filters** – Generate and refine the signal for audio output.  
- **Envelope Detectors and Amplifiers** – Extract and amplify the amplitude envelope of the signal.  
- **Voltage Dividers and DC Blocking Capacitors** – Stabilize the signal and remove noise.
